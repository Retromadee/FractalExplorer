# FractalExplorer

The Fractal Explorer is a Java-based GUI application designed to visualize and explore various fractals.

## Outcomes

- Use Git as the version control system.
- Understand and learn how to design a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Learn Java generics and how to use the Java Collections API.
- Develop multithreaded applications with synchronization.
- Understand and implement network-based systems.
- Develop sophisticated applications.

## Project Overview

Students created a Fractal Explorer application in Java. The project involved:

- Building a GUI-based application to display fractals.
- Implementing three fractals:
  - Sierpinski Triangle
  - Koch Snowflake
  - Mandelbrot Set
- Adding interactive features such as:
  - User input for recursion depth and colors
  - Saving fractals as images
- Integrating prebuilt networking code to send fractal configurations

## Requirements

- Java JDK and SDK (version 8 or higher)

## How to Run

1. Extract the project and navigate to the `FractalExplorer` folder.
2. Ensure Java JDK and SDK are installed by running `java -version` and `javac -version` in the terminal.
3. Compile the project with:
   ```bash
   javac FractalExplorer.java
   ```

4. Run the project with:
   ```bash
   java FractalExplorer
   ```
## Eclipse Project RUN
```
Import Project Into Ecllipse
Navigate to FractalExplorer
Right click
goto Build Path
Remove any existing Build Path(If any)
Select Use as Source Folder
```

## Deliverables

- A functional Fractal Explorer application.
- Implementation of the Sierpinski Triangle, Koch Snowflake, and Mandelbrot Set.
- GUI with:
    - Depth and color controls
    - Save as image functionality
- Multithreaded rendering for responsiveness.
- Integration of networking for fractal sharing.
